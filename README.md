RSS generator for Twitter feeds


Twitter switched off its RSS feeds on June 2013. rss4twitter is a RSS generator that aims to 
fill this void. It will be deployable on the Google App Engine. 

It is primarily inspired by the twitter-rss(https://github.com/Astalaseven/twitter-rss) project, 
but a complete re-write to make it deployable on GAE. Also the web-scraping logic is re-written 
to utilize CSS classes to be more robust.

RSS generator for Twitter feeds


Twitter switched off its RSS feeds on June 2013. rss4twitter is a RSS generator that aims to 
fill this void. It will be deployable on the Google App Engine. 

Primarily inspired by the [twitter-rss](https://github.com/Astalaseven/twitter-rss) 
project - but completely re-written to be deployable on the Google App Engine.
The scraping logic is updated to utilize CSS classes to be more robust.
